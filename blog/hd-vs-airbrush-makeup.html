    <h1 class="text-center text-primary mb-4">HD vs Airbrush Bridal Makeup: Which is Better?</h1>
    <p class="lead text-muted text-center mb-5">By <strong>Nancy Sethumadhavan</strong> | Zanilia Beauty Parlor, Kerala</p>
    <p>Every Kerala bride wonders whether to go for HD makeup or Airbrush — both techniques are professional, but the results vary depending on your skin type and wedding environment.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-4 text-primary">What is HD Makeup?</h3>
    <p>HD (High Definition) makeup uses ultra-fine products that give a flawless finish under bright lighting and cameras. It’s ideal for brides who want a natural yet photo-perfect look.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-4 text-primary">What is Airbrush Makeup?</h3>
    <p>Airbrush makeup involves spraying a fine mist using an airbrush gun. It creates a smooth, lightweight, and sweat-resistant layer — perfect for Kerala’s humid weather.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-4 text-primary">Which One Should You Choose?</h3>
    <p>If you have dry or sensitive skin, go for HD makeup. For long ceremonies or outdoor shoots, Airbrush is your best friend. At Zanilia, we tailor the technique to suit your comfort and skin type.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">No matter which option you choose, <strong>Nancy Sethumadhavan</strong> ensures every bride looks radiant, confident, and camera-ready on her big day.</p>
